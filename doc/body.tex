\section{Dataset Model}
\label{sect:ds}

This section describes the generic, high-level metadata associated with an
IVOA Dataset. Since serialization format choices may effect the number of
files or components which comprise a dataset, we define an IVOA Dataset as
"a file or files which are considered to be a single deliverable".
Examples of viable datasets include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item An individual data product, such as a Spectrum, or Image.
  \item A 'tar' file or directory of processed observational data files.
\end{itemize}

This metadata identifies the dataset, and provides information regarding the
ownership, rights and associations with other datasets. The primary purpose
of this metadata is to facilitate the registry and discovery of datasets
within the IVOA community.

Several of the objects modeled here are based on descriptions given in the IVOA
document, "Resource Metadata for the Virtual Observatory; Version 1.12" \citep{2007ivoa.spec.0302H}
(Resource Metadata). Where applicable, we provide the appropriate citation
in the text below.

  The Curation object provides metadata assigned by the entity responsible for
  the support of the dataset content as well as identifying metadata about that
  entity. It is assembled from definitions provided by the IVOA Resource
  Metadata document. Here, we provide a brief description of each field for easy
  reference, along with a notation of its mapping to the Resource Metadata
  document (RM:field), where the reader may find more detailed information.

  \subsubsection{Curation.contact}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:contact]{Contact}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 0..1} \newline 

  Contact information of the person/entity responsible for the content of the

  individuals whose information may more easily become obsolete. (RM:Curation.Contact)
  
  \subsubsection{Curation.publisher}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:publisher]{Publisher}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 1} \newline
  
  The entity making the data available. (RM:Curation.Publisher)

  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:ivoa]{anyURI}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 0..1} \newline
  
  IVOA dataset identifier assigned by the publisher to uniquely identify the
  dataset within its holdings. Typically, the basis of this identifier will
  be the publisher ID. However, if the publisher chooses to use a 'global index
  service' such as ADS to obtain persistent identifiers for their datasets,
  rather than generate their own, that identifier should be used both here and
  for DataID.datasetID. Note: this model also defines a creator dataset ID
  (DataID.creatorDID), these will differ if the publishing entity is not
  the creator of the dataset. Values are to be expressed as dataset identifiers
  using the syntax described in "IVOA Identifiers" \citep{2007ivoa.spec.0314P}.
  
  \subsubsection{Curation.reference}

  RightsType enumeration set. (RM:Collection.Rights)
  
  \subsubsection{Curation.version}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:ivoa]{string}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 0..1} \newline
  
  Version of the curated dataset, assigned by the publisher. This is an
  independent versioning from DataID.version that allows the publisher to track
  changes to the high level dataset metadata (e.g. curation metadata,
  identifiers, etc.) without effecting the creator defined dataset version. The
  value may be based on the DataID.version (e.g. by adding a sub-version extension),
  or an independent versioning. There are no format restrictions on the value. (RM:Curation.Version)

  The Data Identification object (DataID) stores the dataset identifiers and
  other metadata typically assigned by the dataset creator.
  
  The Dataset IDs in this object must comply with the syntax for dataset
  identifiers defined in the "IVOA Identifiers" \citep{2007ivoa.spec.0314P} document, including
  the use of 'stop' characters to identify specific datasets that are
  not individually in the registry. e.g., ivo://example.net/aservice?2013/5/2342.
  
  Much of the content of this object is assembled from various definitions in
  the IVOA Resource Metadata document. Here, we provide a brief description
  of each field for easy reference, along with a notation of its mapping to
  the Resource Metadata document (RM:field), where the reader may find more
  detailed information.

  \subsubsection{DataID.collection}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:collection]{Collection}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 0..*} \newline
  
  The dataset is associated with zero or more Collections (instrument name,
  survey name, etc.) . Each instance identifies a tag indicating some degree of
  compatibility with other data sharing the same Collection properties.
  
  \subsubsection{DataID.contributor}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:contributor]{Contributor}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 0..*} \newline

  \textbf{multiplicity: 0..1} \newline
  
  The dataset creation type describes the nature or genre of the content. Values
  are restricted to the CreationType enumeration set. (RM:General.Type)
  
  Note: This field provides information about the process by which the dataset
  was created. As the Observation/Experiment model matures, this may evolve
  into a provenance element on the Experiment type.
  
  \subsubsection{DataID.creator}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:creator]{Creator}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 0..1} \newline
  
  The institution or entity which created the dataset. (RM:Curation.Creator)
  
  \subsubsection{DataID.creatorDID}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:ivoa]{anyURI}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 0..1} \newline
  
  The dataset identifier assigned by the creator. Here, the authority-id of the
  identifier must be that of the creator. It is used to identify the original
  exposure of the dataset in an archive, and will remain static regardless of
  where the dataset is published. The creator ID will not necessarily change
  even if the VO object in question is a cutout or is otherwise further processed.
  
  \subsubsection{DataID.datasetID}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:ivoa]{anyURI}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 0..1} \newline
  
  If the dataset is registered with an external 'global index service' such as
  ADS, the publisher may include that identifier here. This provides a common,
  persistent identifier for the dataset, and possible access point to follow
  for information on publications and other related datasets. Note: the same
  dataset published at more than one location would have different
  Curation.publisherDID values, but the same DataID.datasetID.
  eg: "ivo://ADS/Sa.CXO?obsid=1234", "ivo://ADS/sh.hut\#ngc4151\_141"

An Observation Dataset (ObsDataset) is modeled as the result of an Observation,
and refers to several elements related to the Observation and its configuration.
As of the time of this writing, there is no IVOA recommendation for a general
Observation data model. The Provenance data model, in progress, will define
the pattern for describing the relation between actions and results, and how
to record these in datasets. In lieu of these standards, this document defines
a strawman Observation model.

\pagebreak
\subsection{Observation}
\label{sect:observation}

  Head class for an Observation Experiment.
  
  The Observation is modeled as a type of 'Experiment', with some basic
  structure defined to provide metadata about the observation target and
  configuration. The product, or 'result' of the Observation is zero or more
  ObsDataset objects. This pattern is inspired by, and compatible with the
  Simulation Data Model \citep{2012ivoa.spec.0503L}, where a 'Simulation' can be considered another form
  of 'Experiment' or perhaps even another form of 'Observation'.

  \subsubsection{Observation.observationID}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:ivoa]{string}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 1} \newline

  Internal ID determined by the data provider to uniquely identify the
  observation within the institution or entity performing the observation.  
  
  \subsubsection{Observation.target}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:basetarget]{BaseTarget}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 1} \newline

  The target of the observation. The content of this object may vary greatly
  depending on the goals and nature of the observation. For example, the
  'target' could be a galaxy, stellar object, planet, or calibration source. As
  such, we allow the BaseTarget class here, and permit users to define and use
  more content rich flavors according to their needs.
  
  \subsubsection{Observation.obsConfig}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:obsconfig]{ObsConfig}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 1} \newline

  Observation configuration metadata, provides information about who, where,
  and how the observation was conducted.
  
  \subsubsection{Observation.proposal}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:proposal]{Proposal}} \newline

  \subsubsection{Observation.result}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:obs_ds]{ObsDataset}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 0..*} \newline

  The result of an observation is zero or more Observation Datasets.
  
  
\subsection{ObsDataset}
\label{sect:obs_ds}

  ObsDataset is an extension of Dataset defining additional metadata relevant to
  Datasets which are derived from Observations. This metadata gives a high-level
  summary of the coverage of the dataset in coordinate space, as well as the
  coordinate systems used, and general information about the observation itself.

  \subsubsection{ObsDataset.calibLevel}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:ivoa]{integer}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 0..1} \newline

  High level classification for the calibration level of a particular dataset
  as a whole. The calibration level concept conveys to the user information on
  how much data reduction/processing has been applied to the data. It is up to
  the data providers to consider how to map their own internal classification to
  the scale defined here.
  
  Scale:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item[] 0 - Raw instrumental data, in a proprietary or internal data-provider defined format.
  \item[] 1 - Instrumental data in a standard format (FITS, VOTable, etc )
  \item[] 2 - Calibrated, science ready data with the instrument signature removed.
  \item[] 3 - Enhanced data products like mosaics, resampled or drizzled images,
              or heavily processed survey fields. Level 3 data products may represent the
              combination of data from multiple primary observations.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \subsubsection{ObsDataset.derived}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:derived]{Derived}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 0..1} \newline

  Provides a high level summary of certain properties of the dataset. Its
  primary purpose is to support high level filtering of datasets during data
  discovery.
  
  \subsubsection{ObsDataset.obsConfig}

  \subsubsection{ObsDataset.observationID}
  \textbf{type: id} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: n/a} \newline

\subsection{AstroTarget}
\label{sect:astrotarget}

  Extension of BaseTarget specialized for astronomical objects. The AstroTarget
  defines additional astronomical properties of the target.

  \subsubsection{AstroTarget.name}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:ivoa]{string}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 1} \newline

  When referring to an astronomical target, one may specify a particular
  object, or a more general target such as the name of a survey field. When
  specifying a particular object, it is highly recommended to use a name
  suitable for input to a name resolver.
  
  \subsubsection{AstroTarget.position}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:pos]{Position}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 0..1} \newline

  In the context of the astronomical target, this field gives the nominal RA and
  Dec location for the target. For example, the catalog position of the
  source.  
  
  \subsubsection{AstroTarget.objectClass}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:ivoa]{string}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 0..1} \newline

  General classification or type of the target. This field supports the
  discovery of data pertaining to a common class of object, e.g. "Star", "
  Galaxy", "AGN". At the time of this writing, there is no IVOA recommended
  vocabulary for this field. The SIMBAD and NED databases use defined
  vocabularies for astronomical object classifications which may serve as the
  basis for such.
  
  \subsubsection{AstroTarget.spectralClass}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:ivoa]{string}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 0..1} \newline

  Spectral class of the object. As with objectClass, there is no IVOA
  recommended vocabulary for specifying the spectral class of an object. There
  is an IVOA Note on the subject entitled "An encoding system to represent
  stellar spectral classes in archival databases and catalogs" \citep{note:SpectralClasses},
  describing an encoding system which has been adopted by the MAST archive.  
  
  \subsubsection{AstroTarget.redshift}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:ivoa]{real}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 0..1} \newline

  This field gives the canonical redshift of the astronomical object. It is
  normally used to store the cosmological redshift of extragalactic objects,
  although it may also be used to store the observed redshift of Galactic
  sources if that information is felt by the data provider to be useful.  
  
  \subsubsection{AstroTarget.varAmpl}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:ivoa]{real}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 0..1} \newline

  Canonical variability amplitude attributed to the target.


\pagebreak
\subsection{BaseTarget}
\label{sect:basetarget}

  Abstract base class for the Target object tree. The target object provides
  identifying metadata related to the subject or goal of the experiment. For an
  Observational experiment, this would typically be an astronomical object. The
  BaseTarget class defines high-level identifying information, and must be
  extended for particular classes of Target which may define additional characteristics.

  \subsubsection{BaseTarget.name}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:ivoa]{string}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 1} \newline

  The target name. The primary purpose of this field is to provide the user with
  a recognizable identity of the particular subject or goal. However, since this
  may be a query-able field in data discovery protocols, care should be taken to
  use values which follow conventions for the domain appropriate for the data.
  For an astronomical object, this may be a name suitable for use within a
  domain-specific resolution service. Simulated data might also use this sort of
  name (if simulating a particular object), or a more generic term such as "G2V star".
  
  \subsubsection{BaseTarget.description}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:ivoa]{string}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 0..1} \newline

  Free form description of target.
  
  \subsubsection{BaseTarget.position}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:pos]{Position}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 0..1} \newline

  This field provides the spatial location of the target. The value is a
  Position object which supports all required dimensionality and coordinate
  frame specification needs.

  The Derived (short for Derived Data) object holds derived information obtained
  by evaluating or analyzing the contents of the dataset. The specific content
  of this object is strongly dependent on the specific type of dataset, so we
  provide a generic model which may be specialized in other models to define
  elements appropriate for that type of dataset.
  
  The primary purpose of this object is to provide a common framework in which
  specific information may be placed to aid in discovery and filtering of
  datasets in various access protocols.

  \subsubsection{DerivedScalar.derivedElement}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:derived_element]{DerivedElement}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 0..*} \newline

  Collection of zero or more DerivedElement objects, each of which provides a
  specific quantity obtained by analyzing the dataset content.
  
\subsection{DerivedElement}
\label{sect:derived_element}

Abstract base for defining derived data elements. Typically, models for
specific data products would extend this object to define various elements
appropriate for that model. For example, the Spectrum model could define
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), or TimeSeries could define period, or
variability. We put no restriction on the DerivedElement content since the
result could be a simple value or a complex object. However, it is recommended
that extensions be simple and compact in keeping with the primary intent of
use in data discovery.

\subsection{DerivedScalar}
\label{sect:derived_scalar}
Simple extension of DerivedElement class which can serve many use cases.
Usages of this object in other models to define specific elements should
explicitly define the element name, and the process by which the value is
determined.

  \subsubsection{DerivedScalar.name}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:ivoa]{string}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 1} \newline

  Name identifying the derived element.

\subsection{Facility}
\label{sect:facility}

The Facility performing the observation. This is modeled as the Role played by
a particular Organization (Party entity).

\subsection{Instrument}
\label{sect:instrument}

The instrument used to create the data. This can be a specific instrument,
general type or something else, such as a program in the case of theoretical
data. (RM:Collection.Instrument)

\subsection{ObsConfig}
\label{sect:obsconfig}

ObsConfig describes all Observation Configuration metadata. We define a small
set of configuration elements which are required as Provenance in the
observation dataset.

  \subsubsection{ObsConfig.bandpass}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:ivoa]{string}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 0..1} \newline

  Describes the Spectral domain of the Observation in very general sense.

  The value may be expressed in terms of general spectral bands, or specific
  bandpass names. If multiple bands are covered, the value may be a comma
  delimited combination of appropriate bands. If expressed as general bands, the
  value(s) must be selected from the enumerated set given by the SpectralBand
  type (Section \ref{sect:band}) . There is no controlled vocabulary for specific
  bandpass names as the list is too long to enumerate. Effort should be made
  to use highly recognized bandpass names (eg: "U","V","B","R","I", "H-alpha").
  
  This field corresponds to both the Coverage.Spectral and Coverage.Spectral.
  Bandpass fields of the Resource Metadata document.
  
  \subsubsection{ObsConfig.dataSource}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:ivoa]{string}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 0..1} \newline

  Describes the original source of the data in a very general fashion. In
  other words, ``What sort of observation originally generated the data?''
  Suggested values include:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{survey}: Survey data typically covers some region of observational parameter space with as complete as possible coverage within that region.
  \item \textbf{pointed}: Pointed data of a particular object or field.
  \item \textbf{theory}: Theory data, generated based on a theoretical model.
  \item \textbf{artificial}: Artificial, or simulated data. Similar to 'theory', but not necessarily based on a theoretical model.
  \item \textbf{custom}: Custom data, as part of a specific research project.
  \end{itemize}

  \subsubsection{ObsConfig.facility}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:facility]{Facility}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 0..1} \newline

  Metadata pertaining to the facility performing the observation.

Extension of BaseTarget, this is a general purpose Target object.

  \subsubsection{Target.objectClass}
  \textbf{type: \hyperref[sect:ivoa]{string}} \newline
  \textbf{multiplicity: 0..1} \newline

  General classification or type of the target. This field supports the
  discovery of data pertaining to a common class of object, e.g. "Star", "
  Galaxy", "AGN". At the time of this writing, there is no IVOA recommended
  vocabulary for this field. The SIMBAD and NED databases use defined
  vocabularies for astronomical object classifications which may serve as the
  basis for such.

\section{Data Types}
\label{sect:types}

\subsection{Base Data Types}
\label{sect:ivoa}
Provides a set of standardized primitive data types as well as types for
representing quantities ( values with associated units ). We provide a diagram
of the model here, and refer the reader to Section 5 of the VO-DML modeling
specification document\citep{2018ivoa.spec.0910L} for more information.

    \caption{Base Data Types}\label{fig:basetypes}
  \end{center}
  \end{figure}

  \subsubsection{Units}
  \label{sect:units}
  This model requires the use of the IVOA VOUnits Standard\citep{2014ivoa.spec.0523D} for representing
  units of physical quantities. This standard reconciles common practices and
  current standards for use within the IVOA community.
  
  \subsubsection{UCDs}
  \label{sect:ucds}
  This model requires any ucd field to comply with syntax defined in ”An IVOA
  Standard for Unified Content Descriptors”\citep{2005ivoa.spec.0819D}.
  
  \subsubsection{Dates}
  \label{sect:dates}
  The 'datetime' datatype is for expressing date-time values. The string
  representation of a datetime value should follow the FITS convention for
  representing dates. The FITS standard is effectively ISO8601 format without
  the "Z" tag to indicate UTC (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss).
  Values are nominally expressed in UTC.
