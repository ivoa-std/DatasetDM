Example Suite for "Dataset Metadata Model", version 1.0:

The following examples are produced by the modeler using a home-grown python 
utility called 'voefg' (Virtual Observatory Example File Generator).

Additional examples generated by an independently developed DSL-based package 
called 'jovial' can be found here: <URL>


Example Suite Summary:
    <ext>   Flavor
    -----  -------------------------------------------------------------
     vot   VOTable-1.3 standard syntax
    avot   VOTable-1.3 annotated with VO-DML/Mapping syntax
     xml   XML - validates using test_meas_v1.0.xsd which adds serializable
                 elements to the base Meas model schema
     xxx   An internal DOC format
            XML/DOM structure representing the instances generated when 
            interpreting the template

  ================================================================================
  observation_full.<ext>
     A complete serialization using the Observation element as 'root'.
     The ObsDataset instance is shown as a 'result' of the Observation.

     o Includes: all elements of the model

  obsdataset_full.<ext>
     A complete serialization using the ObsDataset element as 'root'.
     This basically represents a complete 'header' of a data product.
     Here, several elements are at the top level which were contained 
     within Observation.. these are the Provenance-like elements
     referring back to the Observation activity which generated the 
     dataset.  (e.g. Target, Proposal, ObsConfig )

     o Includes: all elements of the model except Observation.
         
  obsdataset_mini.<ext>
     The same instance as obsdataset_full, but includes only the 
     required elements (multiplicity = 1+).  This represents the minimal
     information to be provided regarding an ObsDataset.

     o Includes: ObsDataset, AstroTarget, Curation, DataID, Organization, Publisher
